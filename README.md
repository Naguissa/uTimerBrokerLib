# STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!!


# Arduino, ESP8266 and STM32 7-segment multiplexed displays library - uSevenSegmentLib #

Master status:   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Naguissa/uSevenSegmentLib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Naguissa/uSevenSegmentLib)


## What is this repository for? ##

Broker library tomanage multiple interrupts with uTimerLib.

It allows to attach multipleinterrupts to uTimerLib, but at the cost of reducing resolution to miliseconds instead nanoseconds.

## Important: Dependencies ##

This library requires uTimerLib libary; it's available on IDE Library Manager and also here:

https://github.com/Naguissa/uTimerLib
https://github.com/Naguissa/uTimerLib/releases



## How do I get set up? ##

You can get it from Arduino libraries directly, searching by uSevenSegmentLib.

For manual installation:

 * Get the ZIP from releases link: https://github.com/Naguissa/uSevenSegmentLib/releases
 * Rename to uSevenSegmentLib.zip
 * Install library on Arduino


## Examples ##

Included on example folder, available on Arduino IDE.

 - Three 7-segments counter example, that counts from 0 to 255.
 - One example to test connections to a 7-segment module; lights sequently from "a" to "h" segments. This example doesn't use library functions.
